# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
I Developed a driver drowsiness detection system using deep
learning techniques and libraries such as Keras and
TensorFlow.
Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a
substantial dataset of images to accurately detect signs of
drowsiness in drivers.
Implemented the solution with a focus on robustness and
accuracy, contributing to enhanced road safety by alerting
drivers when drowsiness is detected.
Leveraged state-of-the-art libraries and methodologies to
create an effective and reliable driver fatigue detection
system.
